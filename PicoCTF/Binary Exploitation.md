# 1. clutter-overflow

Clutter, clutter everywhere and not a byte to use. nc mars.picoctf.net 31890

## Solution:

- First, i analysed the C file given, and found that we basically need to get the code variable to be "deadbeef". To do this, we can exploit buffer overflow on the variable after this, that is clutter, which is what we are asked to input.

- Using buffer overflow on clutter will basically put the extra part of the input in code.

- We can see that variabel size given is 256, so we use hit and trial to find out that the max is 264, after this, the buffer will overflow, using which we can write deadbeef in code.

- I used the command `(python -c "print('A'*264)+'\xef\xbe\xad\xde'") | nc mars.picoctf.net 31890` to enter deadbeef into code. Since, the hex byte represents two charecters and the bytes are read in reverse order.
  
- This gives us the flag by making code and clutter have the same value.


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt what buffer overflow is, and that `gets()` is vulnerable to it.
- I learnt how to exploit buffer overflow

## Notes:

- Nil.

## Resources:

- Nil.
