# 1. Web Gauntlet

Can you beat the filters?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:

- For round1, we know that the filter is on 'or' from the filter.php site.
- We enter `admin' --` in the username field to pass round 1. This works because `--` marks the start of a comment in SQL so the server will completely ignores the password field which means that whatever we enter in the password field doesn't matter.

- For round 2, we know the filter is or, and, like, =, --
- We enter `admin' /*` into the username field to pass round 2. This works because `/*` marks the start of a multi-line comment, so once again, the password field is ignored.

- For round 3, the filters are the same as round 2, along with <,>
- We enter `admin';` in the username field to pass round 3. This works because a semicolon marks the end of a statement, so if we have a multi-statement execution that checks both username and password, the semicolon causes that code to be terminated before the password field can be checked, which gets us a pass.

- For round 4, the filters are same as round 3, along with 'admin'
- We enter `ad'||'min';` in the username field to pass this round. This works because we can concatenate two words using the || operator, so even though admin is filtered, we can concatenate two halves of it to pass this level.

- For round 5, the filters are same as round 4, along with 'union'. We can enter the same thing that we did in round 4 because no part of it got blocked.

- After these, we are told to check filter.php url, where we get our flag.

# 2. SSTI1

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:

- First we test for the language using `${7*7}` which echoes the same thing back, then we do the same with `{{7*7}}` which gives us 49, and then `{{7*'7'}}` which gives us `7777777`.
- From these tests, we can conclude that we are dealing with Jinja2.

- Then, we inject the payload `{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}` to execute system commands and check if it is running with root access. We get the following output:

This indicates that it is indeed running with root access.

- Next, we use `{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}` to list all of the files to search for the flag.

-Next, we use `{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}` which prints the flag for us.

picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_dcdca99a}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt how to identify which language a system is running.
- I also learnt how to use basic commands like 'id', 'ls' and 'cat' where we are not intended to have those privilages.

## Notes:

- Nil.

# 3. Cookies

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

- I opened the website we were given the link to, and as the challenge description suggests, I opened the inspect page, went to the applications tab, and then to cookies, where only 1 cookie is present.

- The challenge requires us to find the "best" cookie. Since only 1 cookie is present, the only thing we can do is change the value of the cookie that is given to us, which is initially set as -1.

- Changing the value of this cookie gives us texts like "I love peanut butter cookie!" etc, with different types of cookies. Since I was getting different types of cookies constantly for every value I was setting, I kept changing the value of the cookie starting from 0, until I got to 18, which displayed the flag on the screen.
