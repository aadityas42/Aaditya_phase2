# 3. Cookies

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

- I opened the website we were given the link to, and as the challenge description suggests, I opened the inspect page, went to the applications tab, and then to cookies, where only 1 cookie is present.

- The challenge requires us to find the "best" cookie. Since only 1 cookie is present, the only thing we can do is change the value of the cookie that is given to us, which is initially set as -1.

- Changing the value of this cookie gives us texts like "I love peanut butter cookie!" etc, with different types of cookies. Since I was getting different types of cookies constantly for every value I was setting, I kept changing the value of the cookie starting from 0, until I got to 18, which displayed the flag on the screen.
