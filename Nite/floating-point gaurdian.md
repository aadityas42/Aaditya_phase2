# Floating-point Gaurdian

## Solve

- The challenge has a small neural network written in C which takes 15 float values as input, using which it computes a probbility, which on when matcheing the target value, will print the flag.
- The network has 3 layers, and the activation on input depends on index%4
- i%4 == 0: xor_activate(x, key) converts x to an integer and XORs it with key and then converts it back to double.
- i%4 == 1: tanh(x)
- i%4 == 2: cos(x)
- i%4 == 3: sinh(x/10.0)
- TARGET_PROBABILITY = 0.7331337420 and has a error range of 1e-5.
- We empoly a script to solve this
